Briefly describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?
The element class is used for more specific groupings of a certain style. The universal element to for a whole page or greater group. The class element is what we have been using in past assignments and for styling items within it's class. Id is pretty much the same as class where it that style only goes with items in its id.

Describe your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes
I chose turquoise, orange and green. I was unable to get hex codes to come up and had a hard time color matching.

Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
This assignment felt smaller but more difficult. I really wanted to get my heading on the orange shape and I was unable to after many many changes. I have a hard time giving up on something like that but am hoping that the rest of the website looks okay.
