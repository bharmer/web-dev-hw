Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?
I learned so much in this class. I had never done anything like it before and really enjoyed it. I hope to keep learning about web design and maybe take classes on the side after graduating. I like that you can work remotely and make things look the way you want them to. GitHub was a great platform, very user friendly once I figured it out. Atom worked nicely and laid everything out pretty clearly.



Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?
I think the hardest thing I have trouble with was getting the fonts to connect from css to html. I think they may not on this project but I tried so many different ways. Color was fun and media felt really easy with the embedded codes.

I enjoyed this assignment because I could use a color scheme and photos that I enjoyed.
Thank you Justine for being so helpful and for a good semester.
