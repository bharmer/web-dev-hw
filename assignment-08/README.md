Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?
1. I enjoyed learning HTML. This was a very time consuming  project but I would not consider it hard. Adding a background of my choosing was new and difficult at first but now looking back it feels easy.
Next Topic we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?
2. I was really happy with the amount of space we were given for this project to deign our page. Going forward with more design elements feels exciting to me.

3. I wanted to make sure my site flowed and looked pieced together clearly with a solid color scheme. I'm hoping that is shown with my end result.
