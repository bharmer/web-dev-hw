1. I chose Baskerville, san-serif and serif because they're classics and what I enjoy using for my written documents. My design processes didn't turn out the way I was hoping. I've been having a hard time placing styles under css and calling it back to my index.

2. The fallback should be similar to the original font so that if it doesn't load properly that it still fits the style of the document.

I've felt frustrated trying to format with the style no longer being apart of the idex and needing to write it in a different file then having it be recalled correctly. I think my website would have looked better if I was able to figure this out.
