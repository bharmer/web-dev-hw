1. When looking for reviews online there are forms for customers to leave their comments. These are really helpful and a way for the general public to be able to express their opinions of what they purchased. There are also forms when looking at a new website, it is very common for them to want to have your email.

2. An example of where a text text selection and button input might be found is when you are put on a mailing list for catalogs. They will ask for your home address which requires you to use the text to plug in and the button to send it off.

3. I enjoyed this assignment. I felt a little frustrated when trying to get the site to look for aesthetically pleasing and have everything line up. I was unable to add color which I really wanted to do but am hoping that the site looking clean and clear.
