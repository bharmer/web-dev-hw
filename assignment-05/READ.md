Assignment-05 questions
1. A page can have multiple head and body elements. The differences are that the head should be telling the reader what the body will depict.
2. Structural mark up shows that is happening within a page by the way it is visually set up. Things like lists, heading and paragraphs are all structural. Semantic mark up is when words are bolded, italic or sticked through. This allows the reader to give an emphasis to the word of choice.
3. My work through for this assignment felt fluid until the end. I am currently having trouble getting my site live. When the URL is put in, a lite pink screen with no work shows up.
