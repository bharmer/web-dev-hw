  <h3> Furr</h3>
  <h4> by: Bliten Trappers</h4>
<p>
Yeah, when I was only 17
I could hear the angels whispering
So I droned into the words and wondered aimlessly about
Until I heard my mother shouting through the fog
It turned out to be the howling of a dog
Or a wolf to be exact
The sound sent shivers down my back
But I was drawn into the pack and before long
They allowed me to join in and sing their song
So from the cliffs and highest hill
Yeah, we would gladly get our fill
Howling endlessly and shrilly at the dawn
And I lost the taste for judging right from wrong
For my flesh had turned to fur, yeah
And my thoughts, they surely were
Turned to instinct and obedience to God
</p>
<p>
You can wear your fur
Like the river on fire
But you better be sure
If your makin' God a liar
I'm a rattlesnake, babe
I'm like fuel on a fire
So if you're gonna' get made
Don't be afraid of what you've learned
</p>
<p>
On the day that I turned 23
I was curled up underneath a dogwood tree
When suddenly a girl, her skin the color of a pearl
She wandered aimlessly but she couldn't seem to see
She was listenin' for the angels just like me
So I stood and looked about
I brushed the leaves off of my snout
And then I heard my mother shouting through the trees
You should have seen that girl go shaky at the knees
So I took her by the arm
We settled down upon a farm
And raised our children up as gently as you please
</p>
<p>
And now my fur has turned to skin
And I've been quickly ushered in
To a world that I confess I do not know
But I still dream of running careless through the snow
And through the howlin' winds that blow
Across the ancient distant flow
And fill our bodies up like water till we know
</p>
<p>
But you can wear your fur
Like the river on fire
But you better be sure
If your makin' God a liar
I'm a rattlesnake, babe
I'm like fuel on a fire
So if you're gonna' get made
Don't be afraid of what you've learned
</p>
