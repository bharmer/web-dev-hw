  <h3> Lyrics for <i>Furr</i></h3>
  <h4> by: Blitzen Trappers</h4>
<p>
<p>Yeah, when I was only 17</p>
<p>I could hear the angels whispering</p>
<p>Until I heard my mother shouting through the fog</p>
<p>It turned out to be the howling of a dog</p>
<p>Or a wolf to be exact</p>
<p>The sound sent shivers down my back</p>
<p>But I was drawn into the pack and before long</p>
<p>They allowed me to join in and sing their song</p>
<p>So from the cliffs and highest hill</p>
<p>Yeah, we would gladly get our fill</p>
<p>Howling endlessly and shrilly at the dawn</p>
<p>And I lost the taste for judging right from wrong</p>
<p>For my flesh had turned to fur, yeah</p>
<p>And my thoughts, they surely were</p>
<p>Turned to instinct and obedience to God</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>You can wear your fur</p>
<p>Like the river on fire</p>
<p>But you better be sure</p>
<p>If your makin' God a liar</p>
<p>I'm a rattlesnake, babe</p>
<p>I'm like fuel on a fire</p>
<p>So if you're gonna' get made</p>
<p>Don't be afraid of what you've learned</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>On the day that I turned 23</p>
<p>I was curled up underneath a dogwood tree</p>
<p>When suddenly a girl, her skin the color of a pearl</p>
<p>She wandered aimlessly but she couldn't seem to see</p>
<p>She was listenin' for the angels just like me</p>
<p>So I stood and looked about</p>
<p>I brushed the leaves off of my snout</p>
<p>And then I heard my mother shouting through the trees</p>
<p>You should have seen that girl go shaky at the knees</p>
<p>So I took her by the arm</p>
<p>We settled down upon a farm</p>
<p>And raised our children up as gently as you please</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>And now my fur has turned to skin</p>
<p>And I've been quickly ushered in</p>
<p>To a world that I confess I do not know</p>
<p>But I still dream of running careless through the snow</p>
<p>And through the howlin' winds that blow</p>
<p>Across the ancient distant flow</p>
<p>And fill our bodies up like water till we know</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>But you can wear your fur</p>
<p>Like the river on fire</p>
<p>But you better be sure</p>
<p>If your makin' God a liar</p>
<p>I'm a rattlesnake, babe</p>
<p>I'm like fuel on a fire</p>
<p>So if you're gonna' get made</p>
<p>Don't be afraid of what you've learned</p>
