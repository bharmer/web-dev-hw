  <h3> Lyrics for <i>Furr</i></h3>
  <h4> by: Blitzen Trappers</h4>
<pre>
  Yeah, when I was only 17
  I could hear the angels whispering
  So I droned into the words and wondered aimlessly about
  Until I heard my mother shouting through the fog
  It turned out to be the howling of a dog
  Or a wolf to be exact
  The sound sent shivers down my back
  But I was drawn into the pack and before long
  They allowed me to join in and sing their song
  So from the cliffs and highest hill
  Yeah, we would gladly get our fill
  Howling endlessly and shrilly at the dawn
  And I lost the taste for judging right from wrong
  For my flesh had turned to fur, yeah
  And my thoughts, they surely were
  Turned to instinct and obedience to God


  You can wear your fur
  Like the river on fire
  But you better be sure
  If your makin' God a liar
  I'm a rattlesnake, babe
  I'm like fuel on a fire
  So if you're gonna' get made
  Don't be afraid of what you've learned


  On the day that I turned 23
  I was curled up underneath a dogwood tree
  When suddenly a girl, her skin the color of a pearl
  She wandered aimlessly but she couldn't seem to see
  She was listenin' for the angels just like me
  So I stood and looked about
  I brushed the leaves off of my snout
  And then I heard my mother shouting through the trees
  You should have seen that girl go shaky at the knees
  So I took her by the arm
  We settled down upon a farm
  And raised our children up as gently as you please


  And now my fur has turned to skin
  And I've been quickly ushered in
  To a world that I confess I do not know
  But I still dream of running careless through the snow
  And through the howlin' winds that blow
  Across the ancient distant flow
  And fill our bodies up like water till we know


  But you can wear your fur
  Like the river on fire
  But you better be sure
  If your makin' God a liar
  I'm a rattlesnake, babe
  I'm like fuel on a fire
  So if you're gonna' get made
  Don't be afraid of what you've learned
  </pre>
