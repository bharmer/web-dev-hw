7.	What is the relationship between an IP address and the DNS?
An IP address is something that your computer gets assigned and is similar to an actual address. It allows for packets to know where they are going when it is asking for information to be sent to it. The IP address has parts to it that keep it organized also like a home address. 
DNS changes the letters into something that the server’s IP address can pick up on. It is the middle man between the user typing the website name into the search bar and the site actually showing up on the screen. Those words have to be translated into number then translated back into words.
